# Love Music? Gillette bot will play any song for your channel!

## **To get this running:**

 - Python 3.7 and up (Working on latest version 3.8.2)
 - Token from your app on the discord dev portal
 - Any song you want... preferably dr disrespect ;)

## **Planned updates:**

 - Play any song by searching
 - Stream from urls to speed things up (maybe use a pipe)
 
## **Where the hell do I put my token?!:**

`client.run('YOURTOKENHERE')`

## **How do I get my song to play?:**

This is where the song file is referenced `voice.play(discord.FFmpegPCMAudio('yourfilenamehere.mp3'))`

Just whack your mp3 file in the same directory as the python script and you are good to go

*Enjoy & Have Fun!*
